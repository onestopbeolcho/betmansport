??Statically exporting a Next.js application via `next export` disables API routes and middleware.
This command is meant for static-only hosts, and is not necessary to make your application static.
Pages in your application without server-side data dependencies will be automatically statically exported by `next build`, including pages powered by `getStaticProps`.
